			<h1>Guess Who's Back?</h1>
			<p>
				Zachy's back. Tell a friend!
			</p>
			<p>
				But no, seriously, welcome to my first-ever Christmas list made in the form of a website! In case you didn't know, websites are kinda my thing now, and I always enjoy having something to practice on. Plus, I've always been <em>that guy</em> who didn't just make a Christmas list, but went all out on it. Well yeah, I'm going all out again. Hopefully you enjoy my little creating almost as much as you enjoy buying me presents!
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, by the way, just a few tips for using the website. All of the price tags are links to the actual product, so use them if you want to get more information about the product, or even buy them online. Also, you can just print this website off of your browser, and it'll look all nice and neat if you're more into paper-versions of Christmas lists. If I think of anything else, I'll make a list here!

			<h1>Techie Stuff</h1>
			<p>
				So, let's be real - this wouldn't be a <span class="make-christmas">Zach's Christmas List</span> without some tech gadgets on it. You know me, and you expect such. Surprisingly, it's actually a relatively small and <em>(gasp)</em> inexpensive list. So let's get to it!
			</p>
			<p>
				First, I've listed some things that have to do with graphic design. As someone who's getting into this whole building websites thing, I kind of would like to be able to fully control all aspects of how I build my sites, from the graphic design all the way to the databases. Most of the programming stuff I can handle, since I've got lots of free software from UofL, but where I'm lacking is tools to get me started in graphic design. Enter my first wishes:
			</p>
			<div class="page-break"></div>
			<h1>Graphic Design Stuff</h1>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="column size-6">
					<h1>Adobe Creative Cloud</h1>
					<img style="width: 90%;" src="common/css/images/adobe-creative-cloud.jpg">
					<p class="small-justify">
						Adobe sells the top design software in the world. I'm sure you've heard of Photoshop, right? Well yeah, it's not just a thing that everyone has, it's a pretty expensive bit of software that actually has lots of accompanying software that makes it even more useful. I used to think that I'd have to just buy each individual product separately, but then I learned about the Creative Cloud subscription. Basically, for a decent amount of money per month, you can have access to any and all of their products (which is a crazy-good deal). Best of all, students get insane discounts on that subscription (and my wife and I just so happen to both be students!).
					</p>
					<p class="small-justify">
						P.S. There are two different versions of the subscription that I'm asking for: 1-month subscriptions and 12-month subscriptions. The price that I'm listing is for the 12-month subscription (because the more months I can have to test it out, the better), but 1-month subscriptions are always cool too!
					</p>
					<span class="price">$239.99</span>

				<div class="column size-6">
					<h1>Wacom Drawing Tablet</h1>
					<img style="width: 90%;" src="common/css/images/intuos4_tablets.jpg">
					<p class="small-justify">
						Believe it or not, it's actually somewhat difficult to be artistic on a computer with a mouse. I could show you a picture of things I've had to quickly draw on my computer with my mouse, but nobody needs you throwing up all over the place. So, instead of dropping some G's on a touchscreen tablet, I've opted for a much-cheaper option: a drawing tablet. Essentially, it's like a giant touchpad, except it comes with a drawing pen that has some thousand levels of sensitivity, making it an incredibly-close representation of real-life drawing. All-in-all, this is another one of those must-have kinds of things if I really want to get into graphic design at all.
					</p>
					<p class="small-justify">
						P.S. There's not a specific tablet that I want. The Wacom brand is supposed to be really nice, and they obviously have some models that are way nicer than others, but just use your discretion. I mean, I don't need a the mac-daddy tablet, but the crappiest model you can find won't really do me much good either. Ya feel me?
					</p>
					<span class="price">$99.99 - $199.99</span>

					<p class="small-justify">
						Alright, time to do things a little differently. Danielle and I have really gotten into Netflix. We probably watch TV shows on there as much as we actually use DirecTV, surprisingly. However, we only have one device that can actually play Netflix, and it's in our bedroom. While that's all nice and fun for watching TV before bed, it makes things kinda tough when we want to watch some TV while we're eating dinner or something. Enter the three devices you see above.
					</p>
					<p class="small-justify">
						Each device has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, the Chromecast is made by Google and it's at least $65 less expensive than either of the other two options, but it also doesn't have nearly as many applications that work with it (pretty much just Netflix, Youtube and Pandora), and it can't do anything like play DVDs. A Blu-Ray Player can do all of those extra things, but it still doesn't have that many apps and it's decently expensive. And lastly, the Roku 3 is probably the most full-featured device on the list, with everything from Netflix to HBO Go to sports channels to Angry Birds (yup, you can play a few games on it), but it's pretty darn expensive.
					</p>
					<p class="small-justify">
						Obviously, I'm not asking for all three - just one! I don't really have any preference either, I'd just be happy with any of them :)
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="secret">
				Also, there's a streaming device that I'm not really <em>asking</em> for, since it's so expensive. However, with everything going on, I thought I'd throw in my vote by having a secret device. Scroll on by if you're not really interested, or <a style="cursor: pointer; color: #2EB020" id="secret-click">click here</a> to view it!

					<h1>Xbox One</h1>
					<img style="width: 90%" src="common/css/images/xbox-one.jpg">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						Yuuuuup, the Xbox One! Who would've guessed that the Microsoft guy's vote would end up going here?
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">
						But seriously, I'd actually much prefer the Xbox One, even though I currently own a PS3. I don't really feel like going into all of the pluses and minuses of each (even though I'm sure you're crazy interested in all of those fine details), but between all of the power of the new Kinect, and cool stuff like being able to watch TV or Netflix and play video games at the same time is just too cool to me. Sure, it's got its flaws, but both systems do, and there's just nothing inherently <em>cool</em> that the PS4 does. If everyone wants to band together and get me an Xbox One, I'd be the happiest Zachy ever. Otherwise, I'll just keep dreaming...

					<h1>Keurig</h1>
					<img style="width: 90%;" src="common/css/images/keurig.jpg">
					<p class="small-justify">
						I drink coffee like there's no tomorrow - or at least I did back when my mom made free coffee for me every day. Now that I actually have to pay for coffee, though, it's a bit hard to settle for really crappy, ground coffee, as it's hard to cough up $4.50 for every cup of coffee that I buy at UofL. I was introduced to Keurigs at Blackstone, and they make some pretty darn good coffee. Unfortunately, though, I'm never at Blackstone in the morning, so I'm forced to get my own coffee, which is where having my own Keurig comes in. I'd save so much money each month, as well as actually be able to enjoy my mornings more with real coffee every morning.
					</p>
					<p class="small-justify">
						Also, this makes for some great less-expensive gift opportunities, as I could really use a good travel mug to accompany my new Keurig (preferably one that would actually fit in the slot, too). A pack of the K-Cups coming with it wouldn't be the worst, either!

					<h1>Pocket Knife Sharpener</h1>
					<img style="width: 90%;" src="common/css/images/pocket-knife-sharpener.jpg">
					<p class="small-justify">
						I'm certainly no pocket knife aficionado, but I do have a bit of an interest in them. Also, I do a bit of help with the cooking sometimes, especially with things involving chopping. However, pretty much all of the knives that I do have are really dull, and I don't really have anything to sharpen them with. This is one of the most highly-rated knife-sharpeners on Amazon, and I've never seen it even reach $10, making it pretty darn perfect if I do say so myself.

			<h1>Clothes</h1>
			<p>
				If only I could see the look on your face right now. That's right, I'm actually asking for clothes for Christmas, and not just a pair of shoes or something, but more clothes than techie stuff (I know, I know, do you even know me anymore?). Some of the things on this list are basically just suggestions (pretty much all of the pants), while others are pretty specific requests (a few of the jackets and shoes). Happy shopping with new, fashion-savvy Zachy!
			</p>
			<h1 id="jackets">Jackets</h1>
			<p>
				Hopefully you can find either some awesome deals on these jackets or some awesomely-close knock-offs, cause most of them are kind of expensive. Otherwise, it's a good start for mah birthday *wink wink*.
